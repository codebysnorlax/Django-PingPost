# PingPost Updates

## Image Cleanup Implementation - September 9, 2025

### Problem
When users delete or update posts with images, the old image files remained stored in the media directory, causing unnecessary storage usage and clutter.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Modified Tweet Model (`tweet/models.py`)
- Added custom `delete()` method to automatically remove image files when a tweet is deleted
- Imported `os` and `django.conf.settings` for file operations
- The delete method checks if photo exists and removes the physical file before deleting the database record

#### 2. Enhanced Tweet Edit View (`tweet/views.py`)
- Added logic to handle image replacement during tweet updates
- Stores reference to old photo before form processing
- Compares old and new photos after form validation
- Automatically deletes old image file if it's being replaced with a new one
- Added `import os` for file operations

### Key Features
- **Automatic cleanup on delete**: When a tweet is deleted, its associated image is automatically removed from storage
- **Smart update handling**: When editing a tweet and uploading a new image, the old image is automatically deleted
- **Safe operations**: Checks file existence before attempting deletion to prevent errors
- **No impact on existing functionality**: All existing features continue to work as before

### Files Modified
1. `tweet/models.py` - Added custom delete method
2. `tweet/views.py` - Enhanced tweet_edit view with image cleanup logic

### Benefits
- Prevents accumulation of unused image files
- Reduces storage usage
- Keeps media directory clean and organized
